Web Style Guide

Sass is an important tool in a modern Front End Web Developerâ€™s toolbox. It's used by many developers to make styling web pages with CSS easier and faster. 

In this project, I used Sass to really dive into the CSS and create a custom design. 

Creating a style guide is something that I, as a web designer going forward, will use often with clients to convey a story for the design.
